# PaskAudio

PaskAudio is a self hosted web music player that works by connecting to a subsonic server.
You have to provide the web server yourself, and build the project for use.

I personally use firebase as a web server, astiga as the subsonic server, and pCloud as
my music storage.

## What and why

The main idea behind this application is to resemble Google Play Music, as in,
have a big emphasis on imagery. I really enjoyed how visual Play Music was,
and I couldn't find anything similar, so I decided to create one myself.
I was also surprised that most existing web players did not handle queue correctly in my opinion,
or did not have genre list / allow me to play songs randomly from a specific genre.

## Caveats

Please understand that this project is, first and foremost, for my own use and as such,
I have implemented features that I find the most useful.

## Closing

If you have any ideas on how to make the application better, I'm happy to hear them,
but I emphasize that this application is mainly for my personal use, so I might not be
willing to add features that I'd never use. In such cases, I'd encourage you to fork
the project and make it fit your needs.
